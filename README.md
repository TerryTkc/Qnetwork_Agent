# Deep Learning Project: Training a deep Q-network agent to play pong game

**Summary**

- Designed a deep reinforcement learning architecture to train an agent playing pong game.
- Employed both deep Q-network (DQN) and double deep Q-network (DDQN) in deep learning implementation.
- Earned 23 scores on average in the deep learning model created.

In this project, I am required to design a deep Q-Learning agent to play pong. The 
player is on the right side and can perform three motions: stay, move upwards, 
and move downwards. I need to train two agents: one agent is the 
standard Q-Learning agent with target network, the other agent is with double 
Q-Learning. I need to compare the performance between the two 
agents.
